# InheritX

**Programmable, Fiat‑Native Digital Inheritance Infrastructure on Stellar**

InheritX is a programmable, cross‑border inheritance and asset succession built on the **Stellar network** using **Soroban smart contracts**. It enables individuals and organizations to securely lock digital assets and automatically transfer them to beneficiaries when predefined real‑world conditions are met, with settlement directly to **local bank accounts or mobile money** via Stellar anchors.

InheritX transforms inheritance from a slow, manual, and legally opaque process into a **transparent, automated, and globally accessible financial lifecycle primitive**.

## 🌍 Why InheritX Exists

Inheritance today faces deep structural challenges:

* Assets are locked in legal and bureaucratic processes for months or years
* Cross‑border inheritance is expensive, slow, and unclear
* Existing crypto inheritance tools are:

  * Volatile and token‑speculative
  * Crypto‑native only
  * Not fiat‑settled or compliance‑aware
* Beneficiaries often lack crypto literacy or access to wallets

There is **no global, programmable, fiat‑native inheritance infrastructure**.

**InheritX fills this gap on Stellar.**

## 🧠 What InheritX Is (and Is Not)

**InheritX is:**

* Lifecycle financial infrastructure
* Fiat‑native and stablecoin‑based
* Non‑custodial and programmable
* Designed for real‑world settlement

**InheritX is NOT:**

* A DeFi yield or speculation protocol
* A volatile, token‑only inheritance tool

## ✨ Core Capabilities (MVP)

### 1. Inheritance Plan Creation

* Create an inheritance plan on‑chain
* Select asset types (USDC, EUR, USD,  etc.)
* Define beneficiaries and allocation percentages
* Assign optional guardians

### 2. Asset Locking

* Assets are deposited into a **Soroban‑controlled vault**
* Funds are non‑custodial and programmatically restricted
* Owner cannot withdraw unless unlock conditions are met

### 3. Trigger Conditions

Supported triggers in MVP:

* **Time‑based** (e.g., after X years)
* **Proof‑of‑life failure** (missed periodic check‑ins)


Triggers are evaluated on‑chain or via trusted off‑chain attestations.

### 4. Beneficiary Settlement

* Assets are released automatically when triggers are satisfied
* Beneficiaries can:

  * Withdraw to Stellar wallets
  * Redeem directly to **local fiat** via Stellar anchors
* Supports bank accounts and mobile money

### 5. Auditability & Transparency

Immutable on‑chain records of:

* Plan creation
* Asset locking
* Trigger execution
* Beneficiary payouts
